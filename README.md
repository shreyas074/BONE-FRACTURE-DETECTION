# BONE-FRACTURE-DETECTION
This project aims to develop an advanced deep learning system for detecting bone fractures in X-ray images using the VGG-16 convolutional neural network architecture. The goal is to create a robust and accurate model that can assist medical professionals in diagnosing fractures quickly and reliably.
